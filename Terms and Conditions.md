# Terms and Conditions 
Last updated 18.05.2022


## General
These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") apply generally to the use of the service vibe.menu (the "Service" or “vibe.menu”), and constitute a contract between you and the company providing the Service, Vibemenu AS, Søråshøgda 233, 5235 Bergen, Norway ("The Company", “Vibemenu AS”, “us”, “we”, or “our”). These terms govern your access to and use of the vibe.menu website (the "Service"), and any video, sound, text, graphics, or other materials sent, received, stored or otherwise appearing in the Service (collectively referred to as "Content"). Parts of the Service display Content that is not Vibemenu AS's (“User Content”). Such content is the sole responsibility of the person or entity that has made it available. When "Content" is used in this document, it refers to both content provided by Vibemenu AS and User Content collectively, unless otherwise specified. For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” means you as the user of the Service.

By using vibe.menu you agree to these Terms and Conditions. If you don’t agree to the Terms, you can’t use vibe.menu. If you are accessing or using the Service on behalf of a business or entity, then your business or entity is legally and financially responsible for your access to and use of the Service as well as for the use of your account by others affiliated with your entity, including any employees, agents or contractors.

We may change these Terms at any time. We keep a historical record of all changes to our Terms on GitHub. Please check this page periodically for updates. We will comply with applicable local legal obligations to provide you with notice of changes to these Terms. When you use the Service, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms and Conditions. That is true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to the Service over time. 

If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account.
